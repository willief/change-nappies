some simple scripts to run new baby Fleming network

Expect these scripts to iterate often and not work at all sometimes. 
All assistance to make these scripts more useful is very welcome.

Thank you to @davidpbrown for the bulk of the work in test_and_report.sh
UPDATE
======
To avoid possible misuse until I can make them safer, bulk testing scripts have been removed for now  - if you still need them  - DM me on the forum
